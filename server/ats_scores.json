Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the \u201clearning\u201d part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.\r\nWe started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn\u2019t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.\r\nInsight Jedi\u2019s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.\r\n*\r\nHow can we work together?\r\nOn any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client\u2019s businesses. But there\u2019s a lot to be done.\r\nLarge part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.\r\nAs an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to \u201clife\u201d.\r\nWe design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.\r\nWe code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.\r\nWe scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.\r\nLocation:\r\nWe are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.\r\n\r\nWhat will you be working on?\r\nInsight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:\r\nFraming the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.\r\nIncorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).\r\nBuilding insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.\r\nContribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.\r\nHelp the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.\r\nWhat will you bring in?\r\nYou will have good knowledge of python.\r\nYou will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.\r\nYou will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.\r\n*\r\n\r\nJob Type: Full-time\r\n\r\nExperience:\r\nMachine Learning: 2 years (Required)\r\nwork: 2 years (Required)\r\ntotal work: 2 years (Required)\r\nEducation:\r\nBachelor's (Required)", "match_score": 63, "ats_score": 94, "matching_skills": ["machine learning", "r", "github", "python", "git"], "experience_match": true, "education_match": true}, {"position": "Web Developer (NodeJS and AWS) | IT MNC Client of Aeronube | Bangalore", "company": "Aeronube Technology", "location": "Bengaluru", "description": "Web Developer (NodeJS and AWS) | IT MNC Client of Aeronube | Bangalore4 - 6 YearsBengaluru\r\nApply\r\n\r\nJob DescriptionGreetings from Aeronube Technology !!\r\n\r\nThis is with regards to an excellent opportunity with us and if you have that unique and unlimited passion for building world-class enterprise software products that turn into actionable intelligence, then we have the right opportunity for you and your career.\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity for Permanent Employment with IT MNC Client of Aeronube.\r\n\r\nWhat we are looking for - Web Developer (NodeJS with AWS deployment)   People who are excited by technology and working with others to develop truly GREAT software.

Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the \u201clearning\u201d part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.\r\nWe started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn\u2019t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.\r\nInsight Jedi\u2019s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.\r\n*\r\nHow can we work together?\r\nOn any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client\u2019s businesses. But there\u2019s a lot to be done.\r\nLarge part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.\r\nAs an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to \u201clife\u201d.\r\nWe design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.\r\nWe code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.\r\nWe scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.\r\nLocation:\r\nWe are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.\r\n\r\nWhat will you be working on?\r\nInsight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:\r\nFraming the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.\r\nIncorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).\r\nBuilding insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.\r\nContribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.\r\nHelp the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.\r\nWhat will you bring in?\r\nYou will have good knowledge of python.\r\nYou will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.\r\nYou will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.\r\n*\r\n\r\nJob Type: Full-time\r\n\r\nExperience:\r\nMachine Learning: 2 years (Required)\r\nwork: 2 years (Required)\r\ntotal work: 2 years (Required)\r\nEducation:\r\nBachelor's (Required)", "match_score": 63, "ats_score": 94, "matching_skills": ["machine learning", "r", "github", "python", "git"], "experience_match": true, "education_match": true}, {"position": "Web Developer (NodeJS and AWS) | IT MNC Client of Aeronube | Bangalore", "company": "Aeronube Technology", "location": "Bengaluru", "description": "Web Developer (NodeJS and AWS) | IT MNC Client of Aeronube | Bangalore4 - 6 YearsBengaluru\r\nApply\r\n\r\nJob DescriptionGreetings from Aeronube Technology !!\r\n\r\nThis is with regards to an excellent opportunity with us and if you have that unique and unlimited passion for building world-class enterprise software products that turn into actionable intelligence, then we have the right opportunity for you and your career.\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity for Permanent Employment with IT MNC Client of Aeronube.\r\n\r\nWhat we are looking for - Web Developer (NodeJS with AWS deployment)   People who are excited by technology and working with others to develop truly GREAT software.

small startups to large corporations.", "1.2 background of the problem with the rise of digital accessibility and the rapid evolution of the job market, companies today are dealing with a massive increase in job applications.", "On average, hr teams spend nearly a quarter of their time\u2014around 23%\u2014just reviewing resumes.", "For large organizations, a single job posting might attract thousands of applications, making it incredibly tough to manage such high volumes efficiently.", "Manual screening isn't just time-consuming\u2014it\u2019s also vulnerable to human error and unconscious bias.", "Inconsistencies between how different recruiters assess resumes only make the problem worse, often delaying hiring decisions and slowing down company growth.", "On top of that, long hiring cycles drive up costs and make it harder to track and analyze important recruitment data.", "While applicant tracking systems (ats) were introduced to ease some of these problems, most still rely heavily on basic keyword searches.", "These systems often miss out on strong candidates who have the right skills but don\u2019t use the exact keywords in their resumes.", "Over the past few decades, the hiring process has transformed\u2014from paper resumes to powerful digital platforms that process thousands of applications every day.", "The time spent by recruiters manually reviewing resumes not only adds cost but can also lead to losing top talent to faster-moving competitors.", "Xi human bias further complicates things.", "Studies have shown that decisions made during manual screening can be affected by subconscious factors\u2014like favoring candidates who seem similar to the reviewer or confirming assumptions based on limited information.", "While tools like ats help filter resumes, many still fall short in truly understanding the context of a candidate\u2019s experience.", "That\u2019s why there\u2019s a growing need for smarter, more accurate

as minor as formatting.", "They struggle with different resume formats or don\u2019t pick up the right information.", "Even when automation is in place, it's often not smart enough to really understand what a candidate brings to the table.", "That means bad matches, wasted interviews, and a lot of missed opportunities.", "But honestly, even many of the newer systems aren\u2019t as effective as they should be.", "They might scan resumes faster, but they often just look for exact keyword matches.", "That lack of transparency makes it hard for recruiters to trust the process\u2014and it\u2019s even more frustrating for job seekers who never find out what went wrong or how to improve.", "On top of that, most platforms focus only on one side of the hiring

pulling together everything needed to make the resume screening process smarter and more practical.", "The system\u2019s designed to handle a range of tasks, like going through resumes automatically, picking out the important bits, building up profiles for each applicant, xiii and checking how well they match up with what a job actually needs.", "It also sorts and ranks candidates and puts together reports that help recruiters make better, faster decisions.", "On the tech side, we\u2019re looking at putting together a web-based platform that\u2019s easy to access and use.", "A solid database will sit behind it to store everything properly, and the system will be built to connect smoothly with other tools via apis.", "Since we\u2019ll be dealing with personal data, making sure everything is secure is also a top priority.", "The target user groups for this system include hr professionals, hiring managers, and system administrators.", "Each user group will benefit from the system's functionality in streamlining and automating various recruitment tasks, making the hiring process more efficient and accurate.the scope of this research encompasses the design, implementation, and testing of a web-based resume parsing and job recommendation system with dual user interfaces.", "It includes the creation of custom natural language processing algorithms for resume parsing and semantic matching between candidate qualifications and job requirements.", "The work also involves performance evaluation through assessment of system accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction through controlled testing scenarios.", "The initial system focuses on technical and professional fields where skills and qualifications can be more objectively quantified, with plans for expansion to additional industries in subsequent phases.", "From a theoretical perspective, it advances understanding of semantic analysis techniques applicable to unstructured document parsing, develops new models for quantifying the relationship between candidate qualifications and job requirements, and establishes methodologies for evaluating the accuracy of automated candidate selection systems. in practical terms, the system provides a functioning solution that reduces resume screening time by an estimated 60-70%, improves candidate selection quality through more comprehensive qualification analysis, assists job seekers in understanding their marketability and targeting appropriate positions, and enables hr professionals to process larger candidate pools without increasing resource allocation.", "The economic implications include potential reduction in time-to-hire metrics by 30- 45%, decreased cost-per-hire through process optimization, and improved quality- of-hire metrics through better candidate-job matching.", "These benefits collectively xiv address critical inefficiencies in current recruitment practices while establishing a foundation for further advancement in intelligent recruitment systems.", "Instead than employing a human method to sort through stacks of resumes, automation could save time and effort.", "Ultimately, it suggests that companies may find the right people faster and make better hiring decisions overall.", "1.6.2 business value its business value stems from its ability to reduce time-to-hire and recruitment costs, two aspects that instantly improve organizational effectiveness.", "Organizations benefit in the long run from increased staff retention and performance.", "1.6.3 social impact more generally, the

support a more efficient labor market.", "The solution also improves the entire candidate experience by making the hiring process faster and more open.", "Xv chapter 2: literature review 2.1 evolution of recruitment technology you know, recruitment tech has come a long way, and it really reflects bigger changes in how companies manage their teams and use technology overall.", "Back in the day, before everything got digital, hiring was super manual.", "Recruiters dealt with paper resumes, face-to-face interviews, and ads in newspapers \u2014 basically, a lot of legwork and time spent going through piles of applications.", "Things started shifting in the late \u201990s when the first applicant tracking systems showed up.", "But honestly, those early systems were pretty basic.", "They mostly helped store resumes electronically, but they didn\u2019t really make hiring decisions any smarter.", "Manual hiring had its own set of headaches.", "When digital tools first arrived, they let companies store applications electronically and do some basic filtering.", "First, it was mostly about building big resume databases with little processing power.", "Finally, ai started creeping in, with simple natural language processing and machine learning to better analyze resumes.", "Still, many early digital tools just digitized the same old problems \u2014 bias and shallow understanding of a candidate\u2019s real qualifications.", "Some tools stick to traditional applicant tracking \u2014 managing workflows and simple filters.", "Others use ai to predict fit based on hiring history.", "There are platforms that skip resumes altogether, focusing on skills tests instead.", "And then, there are big talent suites that do it all \u2014 parsing resumes, managing interviews, and keeping candidates engaged.", "Machines still struggle to fully understand a person\u2019s qualifications in the right context or match them reliably to jobs.", "There\u2019s still a lot of room for making hiring smarter and fairer.", "2.2 resume parsing technologies parsing resumes is basically a niche part of natural language processing that deals with the tricky stuff resumes throw at us.", "Unlike neat, standardized forms, resumes come in all shapes and sizes.", "They don\u2019t follow one fixed pattern\u2014different people organize their info differently, use varied section titles, and format everything in their xvi own way.", "Then there\u2019s all the professional jargon, abbreviations, and terms specific to certain fields.", "One way is rule-based systems.", "They usually get about 65-75% accuracy but can struggle when the resume looks unusual or doesn\u2019t fit common formats.", "These models do a better job, often reaching 83-88% accuracy on benchmark tests.", "The extraction of structured information from unstructured or semi-structured resume documents presents unique challenges, with critical extraction targets including contact information, educational background, employment history, skills and competencies, certifications and credentials, and projects and achievements.", "Recent advancements in named entity recognition and relationship extraction have improved extraction accuracy, with transformer-based models pre-trained on domain-specific corpora achieving 92% accuracy in identifying educational institutions and degrees, while employment history extraction reached 87% accuracy for position titles and organizations.", "The relationship between extraction accuracy and downstream matching performance remains an active research area, with a strong correlation established between parsing accuracy and subsequent job matching quality, emphasizing the critical importance of high-quality information extraction as a foundation for recommendation systems.", "2.3 job recommendation algorithms you know, automatically matching candidates to jobs isn\u2019t just about algorithms\u2014 it\u2019s actually quite different from the usual recommendation systems you see on shopping sites or streaming platforms.", "So these systems have to be way more accurate than just recommending a movie or a product.", "Another tricky part is that feedback is harder to come by\u2014unlike consumer apps where people click and rate instantly, in recruitment, you get much less feedback and it often comes late, which makes fine-tuning the system a challenge.", "Plus, it\u2019s not just about what the candidate wants or what the employer wants separately; the system needs to xvii juggle both at once, and on top of that, it has to make sure it\u2019s fair and doesn\u2019t discriminate.", "Researchers have tried out a few main ways to do candidate-job matching.", "One common method is content-based filtering, where the system looks for similarities between a candidate\u2019s profile and the job requirements.", "Some fancy versions of this can actually understand meaning better than just matching keywords, improving accuracy by about 27%.", "Then there\u2019s collaborative filtering, which basically says, \u201chey, candidates like you applied to these jobs, so you might like these too.\u201d", "But this runs into problems when the job or candidate is new and there\u2019s no history\u2014this is called the \u201ccold start\u201d issue.", "Another approach is knowledge-based systems, which use expert rules or structured info to guide matches.", "Finally, hybrid systems combine several approaches, and these tend to do the best overall because they balance out the weaknesses of each method.", "Instead of just spotting exact skill names, the system tries to recognize when different words mean the same thing or infer what someone can actually do based on their job descriptions.", "This has helped improve match accuracy by around 31%.", "Measuring how good these systems are is a bit complicated.", "So researchers also look at things like how well the candidate\u2019s qualifications line up with the job, whether the recommendations are diverse enough (to avoid always suggesting the same types of people), if the system treats everyone fairly across different groups, and how well it can explain why it made certain recommendations.", "One big challenge is balancing accuracy with diversity.", "If the system just tries to find the \u201cperfect match,\u201d it might end up recommending only a very narrow group of candidates, missing out on people with different but valuable skills.. 2.4 performance evaluation in recruitment systems requires specialized recruitment system effectiveness the assessment of methodologies addressing the unique characteristics of the domain.", "Measuring the accuracy of recruitment systems presents significant challenges due to the subjective nature of \"correct\" matches and the delayed nature of outcome feedback.", "Comprehensive accuracy evaluation frameworks incorporate expert validation through comparison of system recommendations with those of experienced recruiters; outcome tracking through longitudinal assessment of candidate success in recommended positions; and comparative ranking through evaluation of system- generated rankings against manually created rankings.", "Expert validation provides the most immediately actionable feedback, while outcome tracking offers the most definitive but significantly delayed assessment of recommendation quality.", "Industry accuracy baselines have been established with basic ats systems showing 47-58% agreement with expert recruiters, mid-tier intelligent systems achieving 59- 71% agreement, and advanced ai-driven platforms reaching 72-85% agreement.", "Xviii these benchmarks provide context for evaluating the 67% accuracy achieved by the system developed in this research. beyond accuracy, recruitment systems must demonstrate operational efficiency and scalability to provide practical value, with key performance indicators including processing throughput (number of resumes processable per time unit), response latency (time required to analyze individual documents), scaling efficiency (performance degradation under increasing load), and resource utilization (computational resources required per processed document).", "The ultimate success of recruitment systems depends on user satisfaction across multiple dimensions, with distinct satisfaction components for each user category.", "Job seekers value recommendation relevance, discovery of previously unknown opportunities, transparency of qualification assessment, and actionable improvement guidance.", "Systems providing clear explanations for recommendations achieve significantly higher user satisfaction rates regardless of actual match quality, highlighting the importance of transparency in building user trust.", "Xix chapter 3: requirement analysis and system specification the feasibility study for the intelligent resume screening tool has key dimensions: technical feasibility, economic feasibility, operational feasibility, data requirements, functional requirements, performance requirements, and security requirements.", "3.1 techincal feasibility given the availability of necessary technologies like python for backend processing, libraries for natural language processing, and contemporary web frameworks, the system has a high technical feasibility.", "The system simply needs moderate processing power and is made to be installed on common cloud infrastructure.", "Long-term cost reductions will result from the system's ability to automate the resume screening process, which will enable recruiting decisions to be made more quickly and require fewer human resources for manual resume evaluation.", "3.3 operational feasibility operational viability indicates that the tool's user-friendly design and significant time savings will make it very acceptable to hr professionals.", "The system's architecture guarantees that it will be simple to use, and hr teams will quickly recognize the efficiency it offers in processing resumes.", "It should make detailed reports and give some good stats.", "It needs to rank candidates by how good a fit they are, match their skills to job needs, and automatically pull info from resumes.", "3.6 performance requirements the system must let a bunch of users work at once without slowing down.", "The system has to use role-based controls, so folks only see what\u2019s allowed.", "The interface should look nice, be easy to use, and work well on phones, tablets, and pcs.. xxi chapter 4: system design so basically, this tool \u2014 the intelligent resume screening thing \u2014 was built to be kinda flexible.", "There\u2019s a resume parser (that breaks down resumes), candidate profile part (holds the info), job
